        <p  class="description">Chicken and Mushroom Vol Au Vent is the perfect comfort food. Originating from France, Vol Au Vent is a hollow puff pastry shell which can be filled with all kinds of sweet and savoury combinations. Today,  I am using a creamy chicken and mushroom filling that is seasoned with tarragon and Italian herbs.</p>
        <div class="ingredients">
              <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>100g boneless chicken, cut in small cubes</li>
                <li>200g white mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1 tspn olive oil</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 tbsp onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 tspn crushed black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian herbs</li>
                <li>1/2 tspn dried tarragon</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>1 tbsp flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cooking cream</li>
                <li>puff pastry shells</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the chicken first with a pinch of salt and white pepper. Remove from pan and keep aside.</li>
                <li>Then in the same pan add the olive oil and butter. Saute the garlic and onion till no longer raw.</li>
                <li>Then add the mushrooms and fry till golden.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked chicken and all the spices. Stir.</li>
                <li>Pour in cooking cream and sprinkle the flour on top. Keep mixing as the cream will start to thicken.</li>
                <li>Turn off heat and keep aside to cool.</li>
                <li>Take a frozen puff pastry sheet (don't thaw it) and cut rounds out of it. I used a cutter with 5 cm/2 inches diameter. On a baking tray lined with parchment paper place these rounds with distance between them. This is the base of the vol au vent shells.</li>
                <li>Then cut some more rounds of the same size and by using a slightly smaller cutter (mine was of 3.5cm/1.25 inches diameter) cut out the inner portion so you are left with an outer ring. If you have 10 bases you need 20 outer rings. 2 outer rings for each puff pastry base.</li>
                <li>Brush the bottom base with egg wash, place one outer ring on the edges. Prick the middle of the base 2-3 times to prevent that area from puffing up. Then brush some egg wash, place the second ring. Give a final brush of egg wash and repeat for all rounds.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate these pastries for 15 mins.</li>
                <li>Bake in a pre-heated oven at 200 °C (400 °F) for 15-20 mins until golden and puffy.</li>
                <li>Take out and spoon some of the chicken and mushroom filling inside.</li>
                <li>Garnish with chives and serve.</li>
            </ol>
